## Gameplay (copy from document)
The gameplay will be a reimagined version of Space Invaders mixed with a classic Dungeon crawler.
The main goal of the game will be to kill all the zombie wizards to save your dog, going through levels that gradually get more difficult until you come across the boss.

The player’s weapon will be a rifle, while the zombies are able to use different spells depending on the level.
For example:

LVL 1: basic lasers 
LVL 2: Ice magic (When the player is hit they will be frozen for 1 second) 
LVL 3: Fire magic (Player takes tick dmg when hit)
LVL 4: Teleportation (Enemy randomly teleports every second)
LVL 5: Voodoo (Whenever the player hits an enemy, they take ⅓ of the dmg (To overcome this LVL you need to figure out how to get the wizard zombies to kill each other)

(and so forth)

Throughout the LVLs players will have the ability to unlock the wizard zombie’s spells for themselves. Randomly after at least half the enemies are killed an orb will drop. The player will have to shoot said orb multiple times for it to be destroyed, gaining that LVLs abilities.

Abilities will be used to help progress through the game, as well as killing the boss and saving your dog.
During the LVLs a few random enemies will be able to regenerate health with healing potions, if killed these particular zombie wizards will drop healing potions
The Boss:
The boss will be an old grey zombie wizard, the grandmaster of all wizards. Having spells the player is yet to verse. 
(possible spells:

When the boss has 1 hp left the dog bites the necromancer's hand and finishes him off.
